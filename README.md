# YabbaDabbaBootstrapProject
Bootstrap Project based off of the 'Tindog' project from **The Complete 2020 Web Development course on Udemy**. 
I put my own spin on the project to make it more enjoyable for myself as I don't care for dogs or Tinder.

## What's Included:
* READ.me 
* index.html featuring Bootstrap elements
* CSS Folder containing styles.css
* Images Folder containg used images

## What I learned:
* Bootstrap Carousel
* Z-Index
* Bootstrap Grid Layout System
* CSS Link Order
* Media Query Breakpoints
